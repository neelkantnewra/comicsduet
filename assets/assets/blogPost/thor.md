Thor Odinson is the former ruler of Asgard and New Asgard, and the Asgardian God of Thunder. After his reckless and rash actions rekindled a battle between Asgard and Jotunheim, Odin exiled him to Earth. Thor learnt humility while imprisoned on Earth, fell in love with Jane Foster, and assisted in the rescue of his new allies from the Destroyer.
