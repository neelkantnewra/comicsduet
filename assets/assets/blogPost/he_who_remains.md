At the Citadel at the End of Time, He Who Remains is the final director of the Time Variance Authority. He created the Time-Twisters to educate the next world, which ended up time travelling into the past and destroyed the one they were in. Thor intervened and, with the support of Jane Foster, informed He Who Remains that his Time-twisters were causing the past to be broken.
